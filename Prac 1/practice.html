           CELINE Returns to Paris Fashion Week 
        </p>

            The Celine Summer 2023 collection - codified by the house as CELINE 15 - closed Paris 
            Fashion Week on Sunday with a return-to-form show at the Palais de Tokyo. <br>
            <br>
            As is often the case with Hedi Slimane- Celine’s creative, artistic and image director -
            there were layers to reveal. 
            It was the 20th anniversary of his first show at the venue (that would have been his
            second collection for Dior Homme, in 2002),
            and the 20th anniversary of the Palais itself. <br>
            <br>
            Titled ,<b> ‘Dysfunctional Bauhaus’</b>, the runway, typically blended music and art with the sartorial. 
            An original soundtrack called ‘Design’ was performed, written and arranged by the ascendant band Gustaf, 
            while mega-famous Lisa from Blackpink and V from BTS sat front row. Artworks from David Weiss, 
            Alyssa Estay and Renata Petersen were integrated across the collection.
            As a total work in the CELINE manner, the each element contributed to a high-octane frisson,
            allowing the clothes themselves,
            irreverent and rock-n-roll, to give off an extra charge. </p>

            The musician’s latest hair update is straight platinum blonde
            hair with wispy bangs. She styled her look with an all-black 
            ensemble, featuring a sequined backless top and adding a touch
            of contrast with black shorts. The star completed her look 
            with a pair of pointed ankle boots. As for makeup, Lisa went
            Parisian chic with smoky eyes and nude, natural lips on a matte base.
